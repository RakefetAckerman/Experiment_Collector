# Experiment_Collector

Welcome to the **Experiment Collector** platform, a comprehensive client-server system designed for collecting and managing experimental data. This repository includes both the client and server implementations necessary for running the entire platform.

## Overview

This project is organized into two main components:

- **Client**: The frontend application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This component provides the user interface for interacting with the system.

- **Server**: The backend service that handles data storage on MongoDB, and API endpoints via Express application built with Node.js framework. This component powers the client application and manages the underlying data operations.
